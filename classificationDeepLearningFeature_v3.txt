DEFAULT SETTINGS:
	- Train Using Full Data Set 
		- Train: KKI, NeuroIMAGE, NYU, OHSU, Peking_3
		- Test: KKI, NeuroIMAGE, NYU, OHSU, Peking_1
	- 'sliceUsePercent' is 0.5 - meaning weight will be given to top 50% of classification accuracies
	- 'featureType' = 1; --> GM subjects are used
	- 'kernel' = 'quadratic' --> SVM Kernel




TUTORIAL:

	- Data Center Info
			- dataCenterID_training: KKI = 1, NeuroIMAGE = 2, NYU = 3, OHSU = 4, Peking_[1,2,3] = [5,6,7], Pittsburgh = 8, WashU = 9 
			- dataCenterID_test:     Brown = 1, KKI = 2, NeuroIMAGE = 3, NYU = 4, OHSU = 5, Peking_1 = 6, Pittsburgh = 7
			- input the keys of the data sets to be used in 'dataCenterID_training_All' and 'dataCenterID_test_All' arrays
			- 'sliceUsePercent' is the threshold for the weight vector for classification. 
			- FeatureType ---> GM = 1, NormalizedImage = 2, WM = 3

	- Prepare Data
			- Load phenotypic information
			- Load deep learning features from Caffe (previously extracted)
			- Sort subjects and diagnosis labels by taking out bad data and aligning the subjects with the corresponding label
			- Calculate Weight Vector***
				- Rescale it using double exponential distribution
			- Normalize feature vectors through min max normalization

	- Classify
			- Run SVM for FC6, FC7, and FC6 & FC7
				- Store results and rescaled weight vector in detection matrix and save data to results folder
			- Final detection scores are the dot product of the rescaled weight vector and the 3 dimension matrices
			- Vary decision thresholds (for loop)
			- Calculate sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the decisions of the test data set
			- Save the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in the 'AccuracyMatrixAll'
