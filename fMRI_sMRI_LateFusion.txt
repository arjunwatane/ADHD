Description: Multimodal Channel Late Fusion of sMRI Deep Learning Features and fMRI "*Power Map / PCA-LDA / LBP*" Features

Notes:
	- Finetuning did not improve results. Stick to original data. Change paths to the normal paths which are commented out instead of the finetune paths

DEFAULT SETTINGS:
	- Fusion Parameters
		- FC6+FC7
		- GM and WM
		- Deep Learning




TUTORIAL:
	- Prepare Data
			- Load phenotypic information
			- Load deep learning detection matrices
			- Calculate weight vector and get 'finalScoreDeepLearning' for GM
			- Load detection matrices for LBP_onPowerMap
	- Final Classification
			- Calculate Accuracies to save in AccuracyMatrix
			- Calculate 'avgAccuracyDeepLearning'
*			- Calculate fusion detection matrices with GM and Power Map-LBP and/or Power Map
*			- Calculate final AccuracyMatrix
*			- Plot
